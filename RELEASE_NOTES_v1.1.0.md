- **Custom Modal System**: Branded confirmation dialogs replacing browser defaults

## üìä What's New in Detail

### VLAN Viewer
- Sortable table with VLAN ID, Bridge, Tagged Ports, Untagged Ports, Status, and Comments
- Dynamic VLAN detection and status indicators
- Individual VLAN removal with confirmation
- Smart numeric sorting for VLAN IDs

### Configure VLANs
- **Tag VLAN on Ports**: Add tagged VLAN configuration to selected interfaces
- **Untag VLAN on Ports**: Configure untagged VLAN access for end devices
- **Create Access Ports**: Set PVID and configure untagged VLAN in one operation
- **PVID Management**: View and reset Port VLAN IDs with red "R" buttons
- **Bridge Auto-Detection**: Automatic population of available bridges

### Switch Controls
- Enhanced interface management with VLAN-aware filtering
- Get Interfaces functionality specific to switching operations
- Reboot and system update capabilities for switches
- Professional device icons replacing emoji representations

## üöÄ Performance & Reliability

### Backend Enhancements
- New `/interface/bridge/port/print` API endpoint for PVID data
- Improved SSH command structure and error handling
- Enhanced API responses with better error reporting

### Frontend Optimizations
- Efficient DOM manipulation and table rendering
- Smart state management for panel visibility
- Reduced redundant API calls through intelligent caching

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

### Streamlined Workflows
- Device type selection with visual cards and icons
- Contextual help positioned where users need it most
- Clear action feedback with next-step suggestions
- Intuitive VLAN configuration flow from viewing to management

### Visual Design
